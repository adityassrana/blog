I am currently a Senior at BITS Pilani majoring in Electrical and Electronics Engineering. I'm also a Teaching Assistant for the course BITS-F312:Neural Networks and Fuzzy Logic. I recently completed my bachelor thesis at Universitat Aut√≤noma de Barcelona in Computer Vision Center on Deep Image Compression models. I'm interested in computer vision, graphics, optimization and bayesian networks.
